# PDF_vector_embeddings

This project deals with converting PDF documents into vector embedding using RNN,LSA and Doc2vec, and testing those vector embeddings for a downstream task, such as category prediction. The purpose of this project is to facilitate easy document analysis and classification by converting PDFs into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning tasks.

The pipeline of this project consists of several steps, including preprocessing the PDF files, extracting contents from the PDFs, converting them to vector embeddings, and finally using those embeddings to train and evaluate a machine learning model for multiclass classification and interpretation of results.
